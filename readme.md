# Computer Science:  Build Week

## Conway's Game of Life

### Next Steps

- [ ] day 4 blog post
- [ ] maybe add growing vine as border around outside if time allows
- [ ] add 3d CGOL
- [ ] deploy on github pages and AQC website

#### Features

- [ ] Deploy your app using a tool like GitHub Pages or Heroku
- [ ] Deploy your app to a hosting service or, for iOS, to TestFlight (or the App Store!). Web devs can see more deployment info here. (possibly run build and then have server always point to index.html, https://www.aquoco.co/erica-ingram/CGOL/index.html)
- [ ] Expand your simulation into the third dimension. Google 3D Conways Life. Google for how to do 3D stuff on your platform. Web users might check out 3D-ThreeJS, and iOS might look at SceneKit.
